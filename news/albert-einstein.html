		<h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
		<p>Albert Einstein was born in Germany and he was really smart. He discovered that time may not be the same on all planets; this is called the Theory of Relativity. He discussed how a year in a galaxy far away might be the same as 7 years on Earth.</p>

		<p>He was also known as a very funny man, always making smart jokes and pulling pranks on people. Once, when he was on tour discussing his research, his driver turned to him and said:<br>
		"Mr. Einstein, I've been listening to you give this talk 100 times already. I'm sure I could do it just as good as you."<br>
		Einstein took him seriously and the two men changed clothes, with Albert posing as his driver and vice-versa. (Apparently, the driver also had a big moustache).<br>
		The disguised driver arrives at the conference and receives a very warm welcome from everybody. He then begins talking about the Theory of Relativity and the real Einstein, sitting in the audience, is impressed by how much he knows.<br>
		When the Einstein on stage finishes, a man from the public rises and starts asking a lot of questions, because he believes the theory too complicated, too hard to understand and generally incorrect. To which the disguised driver replies:<br>
		"Sir, it is a very easy thing to understand. So easy, that even my driver can explain it."<br>
		He then invited the real Einstein to the stage, who gave all the explanations. When the two men left, nobody had figured out the switch.<br>
