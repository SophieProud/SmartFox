	I hope you will enjoy our work and feel free to contact us using our form.<br>

		<h2>Founder, Web-designer and literal Dragon</h2>
		<p>An aspiring filmmaker turned to Computer Science and the result is a mixture of cinematic creativity and tech-savvy. Still in her first year of University, Ruxandra (known on her Youtube channel as Sophie Proud) is a Romanian dragon, making games for everybody to enjoy. She likes climbing, dancing and writing about the ocean and the search for meaning.</p>

		<h1>Jonathan Hersh</h1>
		<h2>Co-founder and Puzzle-wizard</h2>
		<p>You remember Ron Weasley from Harry Potter, right? Well, Jon is a non-ginger magician, bringing the toughest riddles of our time into small bite-sized chunks. Moving blocks, spot-the-difference, you name it, he can make it. </p>

		<h1>Rebecca Aberdeen</h1>
		<h2 >Web designer and Hero</h2>
		<p>Making a website is hard work, but the one that kept me and Jon alive was Becky. When we were stuck, she knew just what was wrong. A fairy godmother for all web-designers, she's now in charge of all the fun facts, the news, talking to you whenever trouble arises. If you receive a kind-hearted, lovely reply, she's the one writing it.</p>
