		<h2>Or how a second language could save your life</h2>
		<p>There is so much to win from learning a new language. The worst that could happen: you won't be able to speak it. But if you succeed, you can now make friends around the world, you can understand them, you can empathize with them, because you know their language. How great is that?</p>
